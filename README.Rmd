Origin-destination (OD) datasets are ubiquitous for representing travel behavior in transport planning and modelling.
Despite emerging large data sources, OD data continues to play an established --- if not central --- role in transport research in the 21^st^ century, with recent applications ranging from analysis of the evolution of urban activity and shared mobility services over time [e.g. @shi_exploring_2019; @li_effects_2019] to inference of congestion and mode split [@bachir_inferring_2019; @gao_method_2021].
