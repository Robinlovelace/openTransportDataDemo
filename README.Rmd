# Introduction

This repo was created to support at Open Data Manchester's event on open transport data, but it should be useful beyond that event, for anyone wanting to get, analyse and model transport data with open source software for transparent and evidence-based decision-making.

**Talk summary**

The amount of open data on transport systems can be overwhelming, especially when much of it is hard to download, let alone visualise, model and edit. In this talk, I will introduce tools that can help with using open transport data to generate new evidence and analysis in support of positive changes on vital travel networks in Chorlton and beyond. I will show how to download and work with data on road networks, road traffic casualties, and travel behaviour in R, a statistical programming language with outstanding visualisation, geographic analysis and statistical modelling capabilities. No need to 'live code' during the session: all the scripts to reproduce the outputs from the presentations will be provided in the open to support collaborative transport planning research.

# Set-up

To reproduce the code in this repo you will need to have R installed and, most likely, an IDE for R such as RStudio (recommended unless you already have a favourite coding tool that has good support for R such as VSCode).

If you're new to R, it may be worth reading up on introductory material such as the free and open source resource *Reproducible Road Safety with R* [@lovelace_reproducible_2020] tutorial.
See [Section 1.5](https://itsleeds.github.io/rrsrr/introduction.html#installing-r-and-rstudio) of that tutorial to install R/RStudio and [Section 3](https://itsleeds.github.io/rrsrr/rstudio.html) on getting started with the powerful RStudio editor.
A strength of R is the number of high quality and open access [tutorials](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/), [books](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/) and videos to get started.

With R installed, you should be able to run all the code in this example and reproduce the results.

The first step is to install some packages, by entering the following commands into the R console:

```{r}
pkgs = c(
  "pct",
  "stats19",
  "osmextract",
  "tmap",
  "stplanr",
  "od",
  "dplyr"
)
```

Install these packages as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(pkgs)
```

Load the packages one-by-one with `library(pct)` etc, or all at once as follows:

```{r}
lapply(pkgs, library, character.only = TRUE)[length(pkgs)]
```

One final line of code to set-up the environment is to switch `tmap` into 'view' mode if you want to create interactive maps:

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
```


# Defining the study area

The first stage in many projects involving geographic data is defining the study area.
This is not always a straightforward or objective process.
In this case, the aim is to demonstrate how open data can be downloaded and visualised with a focus on Chorlton and with a view to getting the data into the transport simulation software A/B Street.

We will therefore select an area containing Chorlton and enough of the surrounding area to enable modelling of trips to key destinations.
As a starting point, we will use a 2 km buffer around the straight line between Chorlton and Manchester city centre to capture movement along this transport corridor:

```{r}
chorlton_point = tmaptools::geocode_OSM("chorlton, manchester")
manchester_point = tmaptools::geocode_OSM("manchester")
c_m_coordiantes = rbind(chorlton_point$coords, manchester_point$coords)
c_m_od = od::points_to_od(p = c_m_coordiantes, interzone_only = TRUE)
c_m_desire_line = od::odc_to_sf(c_m_od[-(1:2)])[1, ]
chorlton_buffer = stplanr::geo_buffer(c_m_desire_line, dist = 2000)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
qtm(chorlton_buffer)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)


```{r, eval=FALSE}
sf::st_write(chorlton_buffer, "chorlton_buffer.geojson")
```


# Zone data from the PCT

The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is a research project and web application that provides data on transport patterns at high levels of geographic resolution across England and Wales.
The PCT is the main national tool that highway authorities use to support strategic cycle network plans and to ensure that investment goes in places, and transport corridors, with high cycling potential.

You can use the PCT in a web browser by navigating to www.pct.bike and clicking on a region of interest.
By making model results publicly the PCT enables more stakeholders to engage in the transport planning process than do proprietary tools only available to a handful of people with expensive licenses [@lovelace_open_2020].

The PCT is also an open data project, and you can download data for any region in England and Wales in the Region data tab when using the tool.
You can also download data programmatically using the `pct` R package to enable others to build on the tool using the statistical programming language in which it was built.
This section demonstrates how to get and visualise key transport datasets from the PCT.

```{r}
head(pct::pct_regions$region_name)
# zones = pct::get_pct_zones("greater-manchester") # for smaller LSOA zones
zones = pct::get_pct_zones("greater-manchester", geography = "msoa")
names(zones)[1:20]
names_to_plot = c("bicycle", "foot", "car_driver", "bus")
plot(zones[names_to_plot])
```

To keep only zones whose centroids lie inside the study area we can use the following spatial subsetting code:

```{r}
zone_centroids = sf::st_centroid(zones)
zone_centroids_chorlton = zone_centroids[chorlton_buffer, ]
zones = zones[zones$geo_code %in% zone_centroids_chorlton$geo_code, ]
saveRDS(zones, "zones.Rds")
```

Let's plot the result, to get a handle on the level of walking and cycling in the area (see interactive version of this map [here](https://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/772770), shown are LSOA results):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_shape(zones) +
  tm_fill(c("foot", "bicycle"), palette = "viridis") +
  tm_shape(chorlton_buffer) + tm_borders(lwd = 3)
```

# Desire line data from the pct package

The maps shown in the previous section establish that there is a decent amount of cycling in the Chorlton area, at least according to the 2011 Census which is still a good proxy for travel patterns in 2021 due to the inertia of travel behaviours to change [@goodman_walking_2013].

You can get national OD (origin/destination, also called desire line) data from the Census into R with the following command:

```{r}
od_national = pct::get_od()
od_national
```

Let's keep only OD data that have a start and end point in the study area (in a transport simulation, we may also want trips starting or ending outside this area and passing through):

```{r}
od = od_national %>% 
  filter(geo_code1 %in% zones$geo_code) %>% 
  filter(geo_code2 %in% zones$geo_code)
dim(od)
```

The result is nearly 300 rows of data representing movement between origin and destination zone centroids.
The data is non geographic, however.
To convert this non-geographic data into geographic desire lines, you can use the `od_to_sf()` function in the `od` package as follows:

```{r}
desire_lines = od::od_to_sf(x = od, z = zones)
```

We'll calculated the straight line distance of these trips as follows:

```{r}
desire_lines$length_km = as.numeric(sf::st_length(desire_lines)) / 1000
summary(desire_lines$length_km)
```


We can plot the result as follows:

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
qtm(zones) +
  tm_shape(desire_lines) +
  tm_lines(c("foot", "bicycle"), palette = "Blues", style = "jenks", lwd = 3, alpha = 0.5)
```

Note the OD data describes an aggregate pattern, between pairs of zones -- not between individual points-of-interest.

The following code returns only OD pairs with an origin in the Chorlton area:

```{r}
od_chorlton = od %>% 
  filter(geo_code1 %in% "E02001073")
```


# Crash data from stats19

A major deterrent to walking and cycling is motor traffic.
You can get open data on road traffic casulaties in the case study area over the last five years as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(stats19)
crashes = get_stats19(year = 2015:2019, output_format = "sf", lonlat = TRUE)
casualties = get_stats19(year = 2015:2019, type = "casualties")
crashes_combined = inner_join(crashes, casualties)
table(crashes_combined$casualty_type)
crashes_active = crashes_combined %>% 
  filter(casualty_type %in% c("Pedestrian", "Cyclist"))
crashes_in_area = crashes_active[chorlton_buffer, ]
tm_shape(crashes_in_area) +
  tm_dots("casualty_type", popup.vars = c("casualty_type", "accident_severity", "datetime"), palette = "viridis")
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/oTYSwzQ.png)

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
sf::write_sf(crashes_in_area, "crashes_in_area.geojson")
piggyback::pb_upload("crashes_in_area.geojson")
piggyback::pb_download_url("crashes_in_area.geojson")
```


You can get the resulting crash data from: https://github.com/Robinlovelace/openTransportDataDemo/releases/download/1/crashes_in_area.geojson

# Transport infrastructure data from osmextract

The following commands get transport infrastructure data.
See documentation on the [`osmextract` website](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmextract/index.html) for details.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
osm_data_full = osmextract::oe_get(zones, extra_tags = c("maxspeed", "lanes"))
osm_data_region = osm_data_full[chorlton_buffer, , op = sf::st_within]
summary(factor(osm_data_region$highway))
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(osm_data_region) +
  tm_lines(col = "highway")
tmap_save(.Last.value, "osm_highway_map.png")
```

![](osm_highway_map.png)

The same approach can be used to get building polygons:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
q = "select * from multipolygons where building in ('house', 'residential', 'office', 'commercial', 'detached', 'yes')"
osm_data_polygons = osmextract::oe_get(zones, query = q)
osm_data_polygons_region = osm_data_polygons[chorlton_buffer, , op = sf::st_within]
qtm(zones) +
  qtm(osm_data_polygons_region)
saveRDS(osm_data_polygons_region, "osm_data_polygons_region.Rds")
```

# Scenarios of change

You can model cycling uptake functions with the `pct` package as follows:

```{r}
percent_cycling = pct::uptake_pct_godutch_2020(distance = desire_lines$length_km, gradient = 0)
plot(desire_lines$length_km, percent_cycling)
```

To get more realistic results, you would use route (not straight line) distance and hilliness from actual routes, not just desire lines.
Routing takes time but can be done with R packages such as `stplanr`.
For the purposes of illustration, we will use a simple uptake model implemented below:

```{r}
desire_lines_go_active = desire_lines %>% 
  mutate(car_driver = case_when(length_km < 2 ~ car_driver * 0.33, TRUE ~ car_driver)) %>% 
  mutate(foot = case_when(length_km < 2 ~ foot + car_driver * (1 - 0.33), TRUE ~ foot)) %>% 
  mutate(car_driver = car_driver * 0.5, bicycle = bicycle + car_driver * 0.5) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round)
sum(desire_lines_go_active$bicycle)
sum(desire_lines$bicycle)
sum(desire_lines_go_active$foot)
sum(desire_lines$foot)
```
