  abstract = {Clustering methods are popular tools for pattern recognition in spatial databases. Existing clustering methods have mainly focused on the matching and clustering of complex trajectories. Few studies have paid attention to clustering origin-destination (OD) trips and discovering strong spatial linkages via OD lines, which is useful in many areas such as transportation, urban planning, and migration studies. In this paper, we present a new Simple Line Clustering Method (SLCM) that was designed to discover the strongest spatial linkage by searching for neighboring lines for every OD trip within a certain radius. This method adopts entropy theory and the probability distribution function for parameter selection to ensure significant clustering results. We demonstrate this method using bike-sharing location data in a metropolitan city. Results show that (1) the SLCM was significantly effective in discovering clusters at different scales, (2) results with the SLCM analysis confirmed known structures and discovered unknown structures, and (3) this approach can also be applied to other OD data to facilitate pattern extraction and structure understanding.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a machine learning approach to derive temporal disaggregated origin-destination matrices from static censuses on population mobility data. A better understanding of the displacements over a land is an issue for decision making and territorial planning. The primary objective of this paper is to transform census data towards a disaggregated form, allowing its merging with other mobility data. Most of Human displacements are linked to Home and Work locations, and these commuting patterns regularly generate road congestion problems. Knowing the temporality of commuting patterns eases the decision making processes from local authorities. Mobility censuses often contain these Home and Work information, but are temporally aggregated. We thus propose a machine learning model that learns the temporal distribution of displacements from other mobility sources and allows to temporally disaggregate the displacements of such censuses. This model have been validated and showed its efficiency in a real context. The main advantage of our approach is that the resulting matrices inherit all the attributes contained in the aggregated census. Finally, the model is optimized so that it can be applied to other places wherever censuses on mobility data are available, and without additional computations.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the effects of dockless bike-sharing systems on the usage of the London Cycle Hire (LCH). A total number of 707 LCH docking stations are included for a period of 36 weeks. Covariates such as socio-demographic characteristics, traffic conditions, and the built environment are included in the data set. A difference in difference (DID) based propensity score matching (PSM) method is applied to select control docking stations and estimate the effects of the dockless bike-sharing systems on the LCH usage. The results suggest that a significant reduction of 22.42 (5.93\%) in the average weekly usage of each LCH docking station is caused by the dockless bike-sharing system after its initial launch. We also investigate the effects of dockless bike-sharing systems on the characteristics of the LCH trips, including travel duration, travel distance, and departure time. The majority of trips replaced by the dockless bikes are short duration (0–15 min) and middle distance (1–3 km) trips. The reduction in the average weekly short duration trips of each station is 16.91 (7.16\%), while the figure is 15.11 (6.74\%) for middle distance trips. The average travel duration is increased by 0.25 min, but the travel distance shows no significant change due to data restriction. Furthermore, the LCH usage is significantly reduced by 6.85\% during the weekday commuting peak, and 10.47\% during the weekend leisure peak. As to weekday off-peak and other times, reductions are not statistically significant.},
